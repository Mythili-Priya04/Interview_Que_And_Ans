4)//QUE:is it possible to use WCF(Windows Communication Foundation) as Restful services.cs?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5)//QUE:What are HTTP verbs or Method.cs
//ANS:

//*GET-Redrive data
// Mainly this method used to get data from an database

//*POST- Add new  data record

//*patch-update only particular properties
//if we do not want to update all the fields of a particular record in such situation we can use patch method for updating record

//*DELETE-Remove data record
//As the name suggest delete method is used to remove record fro database there are mainly two type of delete opertion first is soft delete and second is hard delete

//*Soft Delete:
//Record is not actually deleted from database but marked a deleted.later if you want to retrive the deleted record

//Hard Delete:
//In hard delete record is permanently removed from database so it is not possible to get record after delete operation

6)   //QUE:What are the parts of JWT token.cs
//ANS:
//JWT token JSON Web Tokens

//1)Header:

{
    //algorithm:"HS256"
    //TYP:"JWT"
}
//algorithm used to generate the token
//The type of the token,which is JWT here

//2)Payload

{
   // sub:"1234556789"
   //name:"john"
   //admin:true
}
//The playload contains the claims like sub name etc..

//3)Verify Signature

{
    //base64urlEncode(header)+","+
    //base64urlEncode(playload).
    //secure

}

// the signature is used to verify that the issue of the JWT correct

7)//QUE:what is basic Authentication in Web API.cs
//ANS:
//*Authentication Means verifying a user who is accessing the system or web api

//Basic Authentication:
//In basic Authentication,the user passes their credentials[username,password] on a post request.
//At the webapi end,credentials are verified

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10)//QUE:What is Rest And Restful.cs
//ANS:
//REST- stands for Representational Transfer.
//Rest is a set of guidelines which helps in creating a system where application can easily communicate with each other

//*Rest Guidelines:
//1)separation of client and server :
//the implementation of the client and the implementation of the server can be done independently without each knowing about the other
//2)Stateless:
//The server will not store anything about the latest http request the client made.it will treat every request as new .no session ,no history.
//3)uniform interface:
//unique identify of resource by URL

//RESTFUL- if a system written applying REST architectural concept ,it is called RESTFUL services


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11)//QUE:What is the difference between Web api Controller and MVC Controller.cs
//ANS:
//*Web api Controller:
//Web api controller derives from SYSTEM.WEB.HTTP.APICONTROLLER class
//Web api controller does not give view support

//*MVC controller:
//ASP.NET MVC Controller derives from SYSTEM.WEB.MVC.CONTROLLER class
//ASP.NET MVC give view support

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12)//QUE:What is Token based authentication.cs
//ANS:
//Token-based authentication is a 4 step process
//1)Client Application first sends a request to Authentication server with a valid  credentials
//2)The Authentication server/Web Api ends an access token to the client as a response.this token contains enough data to identify a particular user and it has an expiry time.
//3)The client application then uses the token to access the restrict resource in the next requests untill the token is valid.
//4)if the Access token i expired,then the client application can request for a new access token by using referesh token.

13)//QUE:What is Web Api ?What is the purpose of Web Api?

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

14)//QUE:What is Web Api Advantage.cs?
//Ans:
//* Every business like amazon,facebook,twitter,need both mobile app and website and web api is a better option for that.
//1)its works the way http works using standard http method like GET,POST,PUT,DELETE for all the curd operation
//2)its open source
//3)its lightweight architecture and its good for devices which have limited bandwidth(JSON&XML are LightWeight)Like smart cell phone
//4)web api controller pattern is much similar to mvc controller . thus ,it becomes easy to maintain and understand
//5)web api has very easy configuration setting as comparison to wcf

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
15)//QUE:Where JWT Token reside in the request.cs
